# $floZ$
A normalizing flow-based implementation to estimate the evidence from MCMC samples. Introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12294.\n

To recreate the posterior distribution used in the paper, run floZ_SampleGeneration.ipynb. Then, compute the evidence using floZ_EvidenceEstimation.ipynb.\n
Alternatively, if you want to compute the evidence for custom posterior samples, directly run floZ_EvidenceCalculation.ipynb.\n
