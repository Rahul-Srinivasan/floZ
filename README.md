# $floZ$
A normalizing flow-based implementation to estimate the evidence from MCMC samples; introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12294.

To recreate the posterior distribution used in the paper, run floZ_SampleGeneration.ipynb. Then, compute the evidence using floZ_EvidenceEstimation.ipynb.

Alternatively, if you want to compute the evidence for custom posterior samples, directly run floZ_EvidenceCalculation.ipynb.
